# parse-test
Parse Javascript example in Node.js using promises

I've played with Parse.com a little bit when I taught myself Swift last summer.

It's a very cool backend platform that provides a TON of ready to roll resources
for developers.

I wanted to give the Parse SDK a spin in a Node.js app. Only two API calls so far, but
it was very easy to do

***UPDATE***

7/3/15 - Updated code to show using Parse object across files
